# Mekanism: Create Goggles

A Minecraft mod that adds Create's Engineer's Goggles functionality as an upgrade module for Mekanism's MekaSuit helmet.

## Description

This mod integrates Create's Engineer's Goggles feature into Mekanism's MekaSuit system. When you equip a MekaSuit helmet with the Goggles Unit module installed, you'll see the same information overlay that Create's Engineer's Goggles provide, including:

- Rotational speed (RPM) display for rotating components with color coding (green/blue/purple)
- Speedometer and Stressometer readings
- Block information overlays for Create machines
- Stress and speed visualization

This allows you to use Create's engineering tools without needing to carry around a separate pair of goggles, integrating seamlessly into Mekanism's modular armor system.
